# Apple Architecture

`apps/apple` mirrors the same "monolith first, boundaries first" philosophy
as the backend (see [architecture.md](/server/architecture) and
[modules.md](/server/modules)) and the same translation `apps/android` already
did for Gradle (see [architecture-android.md](/android/architecture)) —
translated here to a multi-package Swift project. This doc only covers
where Apple diverges and how it maps onto the other two clients; read those
first.

> **Verification status: statically reviewed, never compiled.** This
> environment (Windows) has no Xcode/Swift toolchain. Nothing under
> `apps/apple` was built, linted, or run — every `Package.swift`,
> `Project.swift`, Swift source file and dependency API usage (connect-swift,
> GRDB, Nuke, swift-snapshot-testing, fastlane) was checked by reading only. **The first Xcode
> build is the acceptance test**: run `tuist install && tuist generate` (see
> "Getting started" in [`../apps/apple/README.md`](../../../apps/apple/README.md)),
> build, and fix whatever the compiler flags, especially the `NOTE:` comments
> in `Core/AedstNetwork` and each feature's `Connect*RemoteDataSource` file.

## One project, two platform targets, one codebase

Per-platform UI, one shared business-logic graph — the split is:

- **Shared** (`Core/*`, `Features/*`, `App/Shared`): Swift Package Manager
  local packages. No `#if os(...)` in here except the handful of spots that
  need a genuinely different system API (`AedstColor`'s `UIColor`/`NSColor`
  bridging, `AedstButton`'s macOS `.buttonStyle(.plain)`). Everything else —
  domain models, use cases, repositories, networking, persistence, and even
  most SwiftUI views — builds once and runs on both.
- **Platform-specific** (`App/iOS`, `App/macOS`): thin Xcode application
  targets. Each is just an `@main App` entry point, an `Info.plist`, and an
  asset catalog — the platform's own chrome (window sizing, macOS
  `Settings` scene / menu commands, iOS launch screen) and nothing else.
  Both link the same `AedstAppShared` package and render the same
  `RootView`.

The project is described by [Tuist](https://tuist.dev) manifests written in
Swift: `Project.swift` (targets), `Tuist.swift` (config) and
`Tuist/Package.swift` (external dependencies: connect-swift 1.2.3, GRDB 7,
Nuke, PostHog, Sentry, ...). `tuist install` resolves packages,
`tuist generate` produces `AEDST.xcodeproj` with both `App_iOS` and
`App_macOS` targets, and `tuist build` / `tuist test` drive builds. The
generated project is never hand-edited or committed (gitignored), the same way
Gradle's `settings.gradle.kts` is authored by hand but the IDE project model
that comes from it isn't. **XcodeGen (`project.yml`) is no longer used** — see
[decisions](/decisions). Because Tuist manifests are typed Swift, a broken
target or dependency reference fails at `tuist generate`; this is checked in
CI on a macOS runner only once Xcode builds are possible (see "Networking"
below).

## Minimum OS, persistence and observation

- **OS floors: iOS/iPadOS 18.0, macOS 15.0** (tvOS 18, watchOS 11, visionOS 2
  for packages that list them). Single source: `Project.swift`
  (`iOSDeploymentTarget`, `macOSDeploymentTarget`); no `Package.swift`
  `platforms:` may exceed it. Reasons and the way to lower it to iOS 17 /
  macOS 14 (one constant) are in [decisions](/decisions).
- **Persistence: GRDB 7** (`DatabasePool` + `DatabaseMigrator`, `AedstDatabase`)
  in `Core/AedstPersistence`, replacing SwiftData for explicit versioned
  migrations and control. It holds only key-value and preferences today. When
  the first DB-driven view appears (offline-first list), the approved choice for
  reactive queries is SQLiteData (on GRDB); GRDBQuery is the lighter option.
- **Observation: native** `@Observable`, `@Bindable`, `@ObservationIgnored`
  (swift-perception was removed).
- **Navigation: native** `NavigationStack` + `NavigationPath`; `Router`,
  `AedstNavigationStack` and `aedstDestination` keep their API (FlowStacks was
  removed).
- **Dependency injection: explicit constructor injection** with one composition
  root (`AppDependencies`), protocols at layer seams and `make*ViewModel`
  factories; every external effect is an `init` parameter with a production
  default and tests pass doubles. swift-dependencies was evaluated and not
  adopted (its latest tag needs swift-tools-version 6.4); see [decisions](/decisions).
- **Images: Nuke** only through `Core/AedstMedia` (`AedstRemoteImage`,
  `AedstImagePipeline`); presigned URLs are sent unmodified; the pipeline is
  cleared on sign-out.
- **Networking: connect-swift 1.2.3** (`UnaryInterceptor`, `InterceptorFactory`,
  `ProtoCodec`) with swift-protobuf >= 1.31.0. `grpc-swift-2` is no longer
  blocked by the OS floor; connect-swift stays for its generated Connect client
  (owner decision).

## Module map

| Server module (`apps/server/internal/modules/`) | Apple package (`apps/apple/`) | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `auth` | `Features/Auth` | complete worked example (Domain/Data/Presentation/Navigation) |
| `tasks` | `Features/Tasks` | reference module (never compiled, see [status](/status)); the template for new feature modules next to `Features/Auth` |
| `internal/shared`, `internal/platform` | `Core/AedstCore`, `Core/AedstNetwork`, `Core/AedstPersistence`, `Core/AedstAnalytics` | cross-cutting, no feature imports these back into another feature |
| a module's `api/` package | `Core/AedstNavigation`'s `AedstRoute`/`Router` | the only surface another feature or `App/Shared` may depend on |
| — (Apple-only) | `Core/AedstDesignSystem`, `Core/AedstTesting` | shared SwiftUI components/tokens; shared test doubles |

## The boundary rule, translated

Server rule (ADR-0006): only a module's `api/` package may be imported
across module boundaries; `domain`/`application`/`infrastructure`/`transport`
never leak out. Android's translation (see
[architecture-android.md](/android/architecture)) is enforced by the
Gradle module graph. Apple's is enforced by the SwiftPM package graph:

- `Features/*`'s `Package.swift` depends on `Core/*` packages. Never the
  reverse.
- `Features/*` never adds another `Features/*` package as a dependency.
  Cross-feature navigation goes through `Core/AedstNavigation`: every route
  enum (`TaskRoute`, `MediaRoute`, `SearchRoute`, `NotificationsRoute`,
  `AdminRoute`, `AuthRoute`) lives in `AedstRoutes.swift` there, so a feature
  pushes another feature's screen (`Tasks` pushes `MediaRoute.detail`) by
  value, without importing it. Each feature keeps only its `*Destinations`
  view modifier, which maps its own route type to views, and `App/Shared`
  attaches them. This is the same split as Android, where `core/navigation`
  holds the `NavKey`s (`MediaDetailKey`) and each feature an `AedstNavGraph`.
- `App/Shared` (the `AedstAppShared` package) is the only package allowed to
  depend on every feature — it composes their `*Destinations` view
  modifiers onto one `NavigationStack` in `RootView.swift`, exactly like
  `AppNavHost.kt` on Android and `cmd/server` wiring every module's
  transport handlers on the backend.
- Inside a feature, layering is one-directional: `Presentation -> Domain`,
  `Data -> Domain` (implements its repository protocols), never
  `Domain -> Data`. See `Features/Auth` for the fully worked layout —
  `Domain/AuthRepository.swift` is the protocol, `Data/ConnectAuthRepository.swift`
  the implementation, `Presentation/LoginViewModel.swift` depends on the
  protocol via a `UseCase`, never on `Data` directly.

## Networking: generated Connect stubs are not committed

`Core/AedstNetwork` depends on [connect-swift](https://github.com/connectrpc/connect-swift)
and consumes generated stubs the same way `apps/web`'s Connect-ES client and
`apps/server`'s Connect-Go handlers do — from the single proto source of
truth at `apps/server/api/proto`. `apps/apple/buf.gen.yaml` plus `make
generate` (see the root `apps/apple/Makefile`) write those stubs into
`Core/AedstNetwork/Sources/AedstNetwork/Generated/`, which is gitignored.

Generated stubs are a **build input**, like `sqlc` output on the server: nothing
that compiles `Features/Auth` (unit tests, the app targets) can run before
`make generate`. `make build` / `make test` depend on `generate`, and CI
generates once (`.github/actions/apple-codegen`) and shares the result with
every downstream job. The generated-code dependency is still isolated to one
file per feature (`ConnectAuthRemoteDataSource.swift` is the worked example),
so no other file in the graph names a `Aedst_*_V1_*` type.

### Session, refresh and retry

- **One Keychain item** holds the whole session (user id, token pair, absolute
  expiries) — written with an atomic upsert, so a failed write can never leave
  a mismatched pair (`KeychainTokenStore`). Items are
  `kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly` with
  `kSecAttrSynchronizable = false`: no iCloud sync, never backed up, never
  migrated; existing items migrate on the next write. Write
  failures are thrown to the caller, not swallowed.
- **Sign-in** has two modes (`SignInMode`: `.password`, `.browser`). The
  browser mode (`OIDCAuthRepository`, `SignInUseCase`) uses
  `ASWebAuthenticationSession` + PKCE (S256) with platform APIs only; it is off
  unless `AEDST_OIDC_ISSUER` is set. ID-token checks cover `iss`, `aud`, `exp`
  and `nonce` (signature verified against the issuer JWKS: RS256/ES256/EdDSA allow-list, `none`/`HS*` rejected; not built yet). Refresh uses
  the `refresh_token` grant with no retry; `invalid_grant` ends the session.
  Logout revokes (RFC 7009, best effort) and clears local state. Passkeys come
  from the IdP's hosted login; the app does not call the platform passkey API.
  See the README config table and [decisions](/decisions).
- **Device attestation** (App Attest) lives in `Core/AedstNetwork`
  (`AppAttestService`, `AttestationCoordinator`, `ConnectAppAttestRemote`,
  `NoopDeviceAttestation`). `AppDependencies.didSignIn` starts a best-effort,
  fail-open enrollment on supported iOS devices and `didSignOut` discards the
  key; `assert(action:payload:)` is available but no flow calls it and nothing
  is enforced ([ADR-0016](/decisions/0016-device-attestation)).
- **Refresh is tri-state** (`RefreshResult`): `refreshed`, `rejected` (the
  server said the refresh token is dead, so the session ends and
  `SessionEvent.expired` fires) and `unavailable` (offline/5xx: the session is
  kept). Concurrent 401s share one in-flight refresh that clears itself from
  inside the actor. Refresh is deliberately *not* auto-retried: refresh tokens
  rotate, and replaying a request whose response was lost could trip the
  server's reuse detection.
- **Retry after 401** lives in `AuthorizedRequestExecutor` (an interceptor
  cannot re-issue a request). `AuthInterceptor` only attaches the bearer token.
- **Offline start**: the session is restored from the Keychain with no network
  call; an expired *access* token is fine (refreshes on demand), an expired
  *refresh* token means signed out. `ConnectivityMonitoring` (NWPathMonitor)
  drives an offline banner.
- **Errors**: `AedstError.errorDescription` is a localized human sentence and
  never contains the technical reason (`technicalDescription` is for logs).
- **Time** always comes from `AedstClock`; tests use `ManualClock`.

### App lock, deep links, diagnostics

- Optional biometric/passcode lock (`AppLockPreference`, `LocalAuthenticator`):
  covers the UI on `inactive`/`background`, requires an unlock to return, and
  enabling it first requires a successful authentication (no self lock-out).
  The preference lives in the Keychain, not `UserDefaults`.
- `aedst://login` is the only accepted custom-scheme link (strict parser,
  `DeepLink`). Universal Links need server-side `apple-app-site-association`
  and a paid team; see [apple-release](/apple/release).
- `DiagnosticsSubscriber` (MetricKit) forwards crash/hang counts (numbers only)
  to `AnalyticsClient`; symbolicated reports come from Xcode Organizer.

## Scope cut: watchOS/tvOS/visionOS

Every `Package.swift` under `Core/*` and `Features/*` already declares
watchOS, tvOS and visionOS platforms (floors listed in the Apple README), so the shared
business-logic graph is ready for it, but `Project.swift` only defines
`App_iOS`/`App_macOS` app targets today. Adding `App_watchOS`/`App_tvOS`/
`App_visionOS` is additive — a new thin app target plus its own
`@main App`, same as `App/macOS` was added alongside `App/iOS` — not a
redesign, deliberately, so this is called out rather than built ahead of an
actual watchOS/tvOS/visionOS product requirement.

## Boundary enforcement: `check-feature-boundaries.sh`

Same translation Android already has (see its doc's equivalent section) —
[`scripts/check-feature-boundaries.sh`](../../../apps/apple/scripts/check-feature-boundaries.sh)
greps every `Features/*/Package.swift` for a `.package(path: "../../Features/...")`
reference to another feature package and fails CI (`apple-ci.yml`'s `lint`
job) if it finds one, rather than a SwiftLint custom rule.

## Media variants

Presets (ADR-0015): `thumb_64` tiny lists, `avatar_256` avatars and small square tiles,
`card_400` grids and cards (the only uncropped preset), `feed_800x600` feeds,
`story_1080x1350` stories. The server returns them as signed imgproxy URLs under
`VariantKind` 5-9 (plus a stored `POSTER` for video); the legacy kinds 1-3 are
`reserved` and gone.
`MediaItem.imageVariant(_:)` (Features/Media) returns the preset, else the nearest
one, else the poster; `nil` means "use the original". `MediaThumbnailView(item:side:preset:)`
picks per screen; the detail view and `playbackURL` use the original. The proto
mapping matches on the wire number (4-9) rather than swift-protobuf's generated
case names. **Not compiled:** no Xcode/Swift toolchain was available, so this is
unverified until the first Tuist + `xcodebuild` run.
