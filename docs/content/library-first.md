# AEDST — Library-First Development Standard

**Do not write code that an existing library or platform already does.** Before creating any utility, hook, component, service, repository, parser, formatter, validator, serializer, cache, queue, retry, HTTP client, WebSocket layer, auth mechanism, crypto, date/time, file handling, image processing, drag and drop, state management, animation or test utility, walk the sources in this order and stop at the first that fits:

```
STANDARD LIBRARY -> PLATFORM API -> EXISTING AEDST DEPENDENCY -> APPROVED LIBRARY -> CUSTOM CODE
```

Custom code needs a documented technical reason (missing functionality, unsupported platform, incompatible API, unacceptable performance, security/compliance requirement, project-specific domain logic), never "it is simpler to write it myself". This is a mandatory architectural rule for AI agents and engineers alike.

Read only the page you need. Decided items and their revisit conditions are in the [decisions index](decisions.md).

## Rules every change must respect

1. Check, in order: the standard library, the platform API, the dependencies already in `package.json` / `go.mod` / `build.gradle.kts` / `Package.swift` / `vcpkg.json`, then existing code in this repo.
2. Versions: latest stable verified against the registry; never guess one.
3. An allowlist entry (knip `ignoreDependencies`, depguard, `Tuist/Package.swift`, `vcpkg.json`, `libs.versions.toml`) requires updating the matching platform page in the same change.
4. Design tokens come from `packages/design-tokens`; generated token files are never hand-edited.
5. Anything listed under "Explicit rejections" in [General rules](library-first/general.md#explicit-rejections-do-not-re-propose) is not re-proposed.
