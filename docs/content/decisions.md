# Decisions index

Index of the architectural decisions that shape the stack: what was decided, why, and **when it is legitimate to revisit**. AI agents: if a proposal contradicts a decision listed in a topic page, do not implement it and do not re-propose it; if you believe a "revisit when" trigger has fired, say so to the owner and cite the row. Read only the page for the platform you touch.

Status legend: **Accepted** (in force), **Kept** (owner explicitly decided to keep the status quo; see [Explicit rejections](/library-first/general#explicit-rejections-do-not-re-propose)), **Pending** (known follow-up, not done).

Verification legend: entries about Apple and Desktop were **statically reviewed only** (no Xcode / Qt toolchain in the authoring environment); the first real build is their acceptance test. Items marked `UNVERIFIED` were reported by the platform work but not independently checked by the documentation pass.

Each topic page is a table with columns Decision, Status, Rationale, Revisit when.

Architecture Decision Records 0001-0016 are listed in the sidebar under this section; server ADRs 0017-0018 live in `apps/server/docs/adr/` (indexed in its README). Platform ADRs: `apps/server/docs/adr/`, `apps/desktop/docs/adr/`.

When you change a decision, update the matching topic page here and the Library-First page in the same change ([Library-First index](/library-first)).
