# Library-First: Web stack

Part of the [Library-First standard](../library-first.md). Principles, version policy, explicit rejections and the Definition of Done are in [General rules](general.md).

Next.js (App Router) + React 19. Biome is the only linter and formatter (ESLint and Prettier are **not used** and are not added). Feature isolation: `apps/web/scripts/check-feature-boundaries.sh`. Environment: Zod schemas in `src/shared/env/{client,server}.ts` (do not read `process.env` directly in application code).

| Responsibility | Tool |
|---|---|
| Forms | React Hook Form |
| Validation | Forms that submit an API message: Protovalidate (`@bufbuild/protovalidate`, proto rules embedded in the generated `*_pb.ts`) through `protovalidateResolver` (`shared/lib/forms/`, runtime loaded lazily). Client-only forms and env: Zod (`zod/mini` in code that ships to the browser; full `zod` on the server) |
| Dates | date-fns, **imported only in `shared/date/format-date.ts`** (Biome `noRestrictedImports`); Temporal is Pending ([decisions.md](../decisions.md)) |
| Drag & Drop | dnd-kit |
| UI | shadcn/ui (`apps/web/src/shared/ui/`); `cn` is an npm package from the shadcn ecosystem |
| Animations | CSS + `tw-animate-css`. Motion is **not installed**; rule: Motion only via `LazyMotion` (`domAnimation`) + `m.` components + dynamic import, added together with a docs update |
| URL State | nuqs |
| React utilities (debounce, media query, local storage, etc.) | React Use |
| Server State | TanStack Query |
| Sign-in (OIDC) | **oauth4webapi 3.8.8** (zero-dependency, OpenID-certified; verified with `npm view` 2026-10-08): discovery, PKCE S256, state/nonce, `validateAuthResponse`, authorization-code and refresh grants, ID-token checks, RFC 7009. Authorization Code + PKCE as a BFF: `app/api/auth/{login,callback}`, the pre-auth cookie is sealed with AES-256-GCM (`node:crypto`), sign-out is a Server Action (RP-initiated `end_session` + revoke). **Auth.js / next-auth is not used** (see Explicit rejections). Config: `OIDC_ISSUER`, `OIDC_CLIENT_ID`, `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` (confidential clients only), `OIDC_PROJECT_ID` (ZITADEL: scope `urn:zitadel:iam:org:project:id:<id>:aud`), `OIDC_SCOPE`, `OIDC_STATE_SECRET` (required in production), `AUTH_ROLES_CLAIM`, `AUTH_ROLES_ORG` |
| Tables | TanStack Table |
| Virtualization | TanStack Virtual (`@tanstack/react-virtual` 3.14.13, `npm view` 2026-10-08); reference: `modules/notifications/ui/NotificationsList.tsx`, pattern in [architecture](/web/architecture) "Virtual lists" |
| Testing | Vitest 5, two projects: `unit` (Node; the global `fetch` is a stub `src/test/mocks/server.ts` that answers only the declared apps/server routes, `vitest.setup.node.ts`; IdP calls accept an injectable `fetch`, `src/test/mocks/oidc.ts`) and `browser` (Vitest Browser Mode, real Chromium, `@vitest/browser-playwright`; Testing Library + `createRouterTransport` from `@connectrpc/connect` for Connect mocks, `src/test/mocks/transport.ts`). **MSW and jsdom were removed** (server code accepts an injectable transport/fetch). Playwright: PRs run `chromium` + `mobile-safari`, main/nightly run all projects (`chromium`, `firefox`, `webkit`, `mobile-chrome`, `mobile-safari`; `@axe-core/playwright` for a11y); e2e runs against a mock API that also plays the OIDC provider (`e2e/mock-api/oidc.mjs`, RS256 via `node:crypto`); a contract test of the mock API against the proto descriptors (`pnpm test:contract`, optionally against a real server via `AEDST_CONTRACT_SERVER_URL`) |
| Performance budgets | `scripts/check-bundle-size.mjs` (node built-ins) + Lighthouse CI (`@lhci/cli`, run via `pnpm dlx`, not a dependency) |
| Lint/format | Biome (only it) |
| Unused deps/exports | knip |
| Import-graph rules | `dependency-cruiser` 18.5.0 (devDependency, `npm view` 2026-10-09): `.dependency-cruiser.cjs`, `pnpm check:deps`; Biome remains the only code linter/formatter |
| Mutation testing | `@stryker-mutator/core` 10.0.0 (devDependency, `npm view` 2026-10-09) with its built-in command runner: `stryker.config.mjs`, nightly only. `@stryker-mutator/vitest-runner` 10.0.0 was tried and removed: under Vitest 5.0.x it never activates runtime mutants (score 5 %, only static mutants died) |
| Component catalog / a11y | **Storybook 10** (`storybook`, `@storybook/nextjs-vite`, `@storybook/addon-a11y`, `@storybook/addon-vitest`, all `^10.6.1`, verified with `npm view`), `devDependencies` only; one story per `src/shared/ui` component; the a11y addon fails on violations. Visual regression is opt-in (`test:visual`, Vitest `toMatchScreenshot`), baselines are not recorded yet |
| File size / colors | `scripts/check-file-size.mjs` (green up to 300, yellow 301-400, warning above 400, red above 500) + Biome `noExcessiveLinesPerFile(500)`; `scripts/check-color-literals.mjs` with an allowlist |
| API | generated Protobuf + ConnectRPC client (Connect-ES) |
| Streaming / cancellation / async composition | TanStack Query, `AbortController`, async iterators, Connect server streaming; **not RxJS** |
| AI/LLM integration | AI logic lives in the Go backend; for streaming use a Connect server-streaming RPC. **No model calls or API keys in Next.js; Vercel AI SDK (`ai`) is not approved** (see Explicit rejections) |
| Error tracking / crash reporting | Sentry (`@sentry/nextjs`) |
| Product analytics / feature flags | PostHog (`posthog-js`; session recording is off, replay only in Sentry Replay), only after consent, without DNT/GPC, via the `/ingest` rewrite; `track()` and `useFeatureFlag` in `shared/lib/analytics` |
| SEO / GEO (structured data, robots, llms.txt) | Next.js metadata API (`generateMetadata`, `robots.ts`, `sitemap.ts`, `route.ts`) plus `src/app/config/structured-data.ts`: hand-written typed JSON-LD builders (`organization`, `webSite`, `webApplication`, `breadcrumbList`, `faqPage`, `article`) rendered by `JsonLd.tsx`. **`schema-dts` (2.1.0, `npm view` 2026-10-08) was evaluated and not adopted**: it is types only (no runtime), and six small builders with a unit test do not justify a dependency whose full vocabulary types we would not use; revisit when more than ~10 schema.org types are built. Not used: `next-seo` (App Router has native metadata), a custom robots/sitemap generator. Search-console tokens: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_BING_SITE_VERIFICATION`. Guide: [SEO and GEO](/web/seo-geo) |
| Offline write queue (outbox) | **idb 8.0.4** (ISC, ~1 KB promise wrapper over the platform IndexedDB; verified `npm view idb version` 2026-10-08). IndexedDB is the only durable async structured store in a browser (Web Storage is sync, string-only and tiny); the raw API is event/callback based, so the wrapper is the library-first answer to hand-rolling one. Used only in `shared/lib/outbox/idb-store.ts`. Not used: Dexie (query/observable layer not needed, ~20 KB), localForage, Background Sync (the service worker has no sync handler; Safari/Firefox lack the API), `fake-indexeddb` (tests run on real IndexedDB in Browser Mode) |
| Client UI state | Zustand, **only** UI state (settings, upload queue, palette); server data only via TanStack Query |
| PWA / Service Worker | Serwist (`serwist` + `@serwist/turbopack`): offline shell, push, `notificationclick`; HTML and API responses are not cached |
| Web Push | standard Push API + VAPID (no Firebase SDK; Safari delivers via APNs) |
| Media | platform APIs: `createImageBitmap` + `OffscreenCanvas` (compression), XHR (upload progress to a presigned URL), native `<video>` |
| i18n | next-intl |
| Charts | Recharts |
| Command palette | cmdk |
| Carousel | Embla Carousel |
| Date picker | react-day-picker |
| OTP input | input-otp |
| Resizable panels | react-resizable-panels |
| Toasts/notifications | Sonner |
| Theme switching (light/dark) | next-themes |

**Note.** React Use, Sentry, PostHog, Zustand, Serwist, next-intl and shadcn/ui-ecosystem libraries (Recharts, cmdk, Embla, react-day-picker, input-otp, react-resizable-panels, Sonner, next-themes) are approved **before first use**; these are exactly the entries in the `knip.jsonc` allowlist. See "Approved before first use" in [General rules](general.md): adding to the allowlist = updating this table.

**RxJS was removed and is not approved.** It may be brought back only for a concrete task that TanStack Query / `AbortController` / async iterators / Connect server streaming do not solve; the decision is recorded in [decisions.md](../decisions.md).

**CSP and security headers.** The page CSP is built per request in `apps/web/src/proxy.ts` (`src/app/config/security/csp.ts`): nonce + `strict-dynamic`, no `unsafe-inline` for scripts, `connect-src 'self'` (the browser only talks to its own `/api/rpc`). This is the **only** place for CSP (also for `/api/*` and `/serwist/*`); it was removed from `next.config.ts`, and a test checks that exactly one CSP header is sent. Other static headers live in `next.config.ts`. Any new third-party origin (analytics, fonts, iframe, CDN) **must** be added to the CSP in the same PR and, if it measures anything, placed behind consent (`ConsentLayer`).

**Session.** Tokens live only in httpOnly cookies (BFF: OIDC Route Handlers `app/api/auth/*` + sign-out Server Action + `proxy.ts` + `/api/rpc`); `localStorage`/`sessionStorage` for tokens is forbidden. Web no longer calls `AuthService` (email/password, `loginAction`/`registerAction`, device-id were removed): sign-in is Authorization Code + PKCE against the IdP (ZITADEL by default), refresh is the `refresh_token` grant via oauth4webapi, keeping single-flight.

## Enforcement gates (mandatory library per concern)

Every row of the table above that says "only" is machine-checked; a rule without a gate is a wish. All gates run in `pnpm lint` (`biome check --error-on-warnings`) unless a script is named. Violating fixtures for each live in `apps/web/lint/fixtures/*.fixture` and `pnpm check:selftest` (CI job `lint`, lefthook `web-gate-selftest`) fails when a gate stops failing on its fixture.

| Concern | Use | Forbidden / where | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Environment | `shared/env/{client,server,edge}.ts` (Zod; `edge.ts` is `zod/mini`, no `server-only`, for `proxy.ts` and `session-*.ts`) | `process.env` anywhere else | Biome `style/noProcessEnv` (off only for `src/shared/env/**`, `next.config.ts`, `src/instrumentation*.ts`, `src/app/config/sentry/**`, tests, e2e, config files) |
| Types | real types or `unknown` | `any` | `suspicious/noExplicitAny` |
| Module graph | acyclic | import cycles | `suspicious/noImportCycles` (Biome `project` domain) |
| Layering | `app -> modules -> shared` | `src/modules/**` and `src/shared/**` importing `@/app/**` | `scripts/check-feature-boundaries.sh` rule 5; dependency-cruiser `modules-to-shared-only`, `no-shared-to-app-or-modules` |
| Import graph | `public.ts`/`manifest.ts`/`outbox.ts` as the only module entries, no cycles/orphans, no devDependency in shipped code | deep imports into a module, orphan files | dependency-cruiser (`pnpm check:deps`): `module-public-entry-only`, `manifest-imports-shared-only`, `no-circular`, `no-orphans`, `not-to-dev-dep` |
| UI state | Zustand | outside `src/shared/lib/stores/**` and `src/modules/<m>/lib/<name>-store.ts` | `style/noRestrictedImports` |
| Analytics | `track()` / `useFeatureFlag` | `posthog-js`, `posthog-js/react` outside `src/shared/lib/analytics/**` | `style/noRestrictedImports` |
| Error tracking | `reportError`, `ErrorBoundary`, `addBreadcrumb` / `setErrorUser` (`shared/lib/errors`) | `@sentry/nextjs` outside `src/app/config/**`, `src/instrumentation*.ts`, `src/shared/lib/errors/**` (and tests) | `style/noRestrictedImports` |
| Toasts | Sonner (`toast` from `sonner`) | `@/shared/ui/toast` (deleted) | `style/noRestrictedImports` |
| Dates | `shared/date/format-date.ts` (date-fns; `parseDateInputValue` for `yyyy-MM-dd`) | `date-fns` elsewhere; `new Date(<string/identifier/call>)` outside `src/shared/date/**` | `noRestrictedImports`; GritQL `lint/no-date-from-string.grit` |
| Numbers, bytes, relative time | `shared/intl/format.ts` (`formatNumber`, `formatBytes`, `formatRelativeTime`; keyed by `toLanguageTag`) | `new Intl.*` outside `src/shared/intl/**` | GritQL `lint/no-intl-constructors.grit` |
| Server calls | generated Connect client (`createClient(...Service, createConnectTransport(...))`, connect-query) | `fetch(` in `src/modules/**` | GritQL `lint/no-fetch-in-modules.grit` (hand-written Connect JSON POSTs in `shared/lib/capabilities/server.ts` and `app/sw.ts` were replaced by `createClient`) |
| UI elements | `shared/ui` (`Button`, `Input`, `NativeSelect`/`Select`, `Textarea`, `Label`/`FieldLabel`, `Form`) | `<button> <input> <select> <textarea> <label> <form>` in `src/modules/**` and `src/app/**` (a sr-only file input goes through `Input`; anything else needs a `biome-ignore` with a reason) | `correctness/noRestrictedElements` |
| Forms | React Hook Form + `protovalidateResolver` | a file rendering `<form>` / `<Form>` without importing `react-hook-form` | `pnpm check:forms` (`scripts/check-forms.mjs`) |
| Colors | tokens (`bg-primary`, `text-muted-foreground`, Badge `success`/`warning`/`info`) | hex/`rgb()`/`oklch()` literals and Tailwind palette classes (`bg-red-500`, `text-neutral-600`) outside `src/shared/ui` | `pnpm check:colors` and `scripts/check-color-literals.mjs` (repo level) |
| Naming | `PascalCase.tsx` components, `kebab-case.ts` everything else | other shapes (`shared/ui` exempt, framework file names fixed by Next.js) | Biome `style/useFilenamingConvention`, `useNamingConvention`; `scripts/check-naming.sh` (all `apps/web/src/**/*.tsx`) |

GritQL plugins (`apps/web/lint/*.grit`) are scoped with `includes` in `biome.json`. Plugin `includes` needs the `**/src/...` form (a bare `src/...` never matches), unlike `overrides[].includes`. `new Date(x)` detection is syntactic (one argument that starts like a string, template, identifier, member access or call), so a call whose own arguments contain a comma slips through: a guard rail, not a type checker. Adding a new exception means a `biome-ignore` with a reason, or an `overrides` entry here in the same change.
