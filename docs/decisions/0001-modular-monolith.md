# ADR-0001: Start as a Modular Monolith

## Status
Accepted

## Context
AEDST needs to support a growing set of domains (auth, users, profile, social,
messenger, marketplace, payments, ...) across five client platforms. A
microservices-first approach would front-load distributed-systems complexity
(service discovery, distributed transactions, network failure modes, per-service
CI/CD and observability) before any domain has proven it needs independent
scaling or deployment.

## Decision
Ship one deployable, `aedst-server`, containing every module as an internal
package with an enforced bounded-context boundary (see
[ADR-0006](0006-module-boundaries.md)). Extract a module into its own service
only when a concrete operational reason exists (see
[architecture.md](../architecture.md#extraction-path)).

## Consequences
- Faster iteration and a single deploy/rollback unit while the product is
  finding its shape.
- Cross-module calls are Go function calls today (fast, easy to debug,
  transactionally simple) and become ConnectRPC calls after extraction — the
  contract shape doesn't change, only the transport.
- Requires discipline: nothing stops a developer from importing another
  module's internals except `architecturetest` in CI. That test is not
  optional.
- A bug or resource spike in one module can affect the whole process (shared
  memory/CPU/connections) until that module is extracted. Acceptable trade-off
  at current scale; mitigated by connection pool limits and by extracting the
  first module that actually hits this.
