// Mutation testing for the pure-logic core of src/shared/lib. Nightly only
// (web-ci `mutation` job), never per PR: a run takes minutes.
// Versions: @stryker-mutator/core + vitest-runner 10.0.0, checked on npm 2026-10-09.
// Only the node-environment tests run (vitest.mutation.config.mts); the
// browser-mode and *.tsx tests are out of reach of the runner.
// thresholds.break is "first measured score minus 5": set it after the first
// CI run (see docs/content/web/architecture.md, "Quality gates") and ratchet up.
