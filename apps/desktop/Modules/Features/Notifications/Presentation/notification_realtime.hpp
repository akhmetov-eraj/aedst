/// Keeps a NotificationStream open for a signed-in user and says when it can be trusted.
///
///  - Reconnect: exponential backoff with equal jitter after a transient end, reset only after a stream
///    stayed up for `stableAfter` (a server that accepts and immediately drops cannot make us hammer it).
///  - Resume: the id of the last event is passed to the next open(); a `ResyncRequired` event or a
///    rejected resume point clears it and asks the owner to refetch (resyncRequired()).
///  - Watchdog: no event, heartbeats included, for `idleTimeout` means a half-open connection; the stream is
///    cancelled and reopened.
///  - Degradation: after `failuresBeforePolling` consecutive failures, or when the server has no such RPC, the mode
///    becomes Polling and the owner falls back to polling GetUnreadCount. The stream is tried again every
///    `pollingRetryInterval` (`unsupportedRetryInterval` when the RPC is missing on the server).
///  - An `Unauthenticated` end stops everything: the session is over, the owner reports it.
///
/// The owner polls whenever isStreaming() is false and stops polling while it is true.
/// Single-threaded: lives on the thread that owns the stream callbacks.
