# Import first-party users (auth.credentials) into ZITADEL with their EXISTING
# password hashes, so the first-party auth path can be deleted before the sunset
# date without a forced password reset (docs/content/server/runbook.md, "Sunset").
#
# STATUS: verified on 2026-10-08 against ZITADEL v4.19.4 (official Windows release
# binary + Postgres 17; README.md "Verification log"): --dry-run, a real import of an
# argon2id (m=65536,t=3,p=4, alexedwards/argon2id as the server writes it) and a bcrypt
# ($2a$, cost 12) user, an idempotent re-run, and POST /v2/sessions with the old password
# (accepted; a wrong password is rejected).
#   - POST /v2/users/human accepts userId and hashedPassword{hash, changeRequired}.
#   - PREREQUISITE: ZITADEL must be started with the verifiers enabled, e.g.
#     ZITADEL_SYSTEMDEFAULTS_PASSWORDHASHER_VERIFIERS=argon2,bcrypt (the compose idp profile
#     sets it). By default only the active hasher (bcrypt) is accepted and an argon2id hash
#     fails with HTTP 400 "Password is invalid (CRYPT-r8Qm2)", log "passwap: not a bcrypt version".
#   - Cost bounds (SystemDefaults PasswordHasher.Limits, read in source): bcrypt cost 10-16;
#     argon2 time 1-10, memory 8192-524288 KiB, threads 1-16. m=8192..131072 were all accepted.
#
# user_id is preserved on purpose: a UUID subject is used as-is by the server
# (ids.FromExternal), so every row keyed by the old user id stays attached to the
# same person. Without it each user would get a new id and lose their data.
#
# Idempotent: users that already exist in ZITADEL are skipped. Needs curl, jq and
# psql. The dump contains password hashes: keep it in memory (this script pipes
# it, nothing is written to disk) and run it from a trusted machine.
#
# Usage:
#   ZITADEL_URL=https://auth.example.com ZITADEL_ADMIN_PAT_FILE=./admin.pat \
#   ZITADEL_PROJECT_ID=<project id> DATABASE_DSN=postgres://... \
