# Start here

Agent map: `docs/agent/INDEX.md` (read only the rows for your platform and task).

## Commands (use `task`, not ad-hoc commands)

| Command | Use |
|---|---|
| `task --list` | Everything available |
| `task doctor` | Which toolchains exist here and which verification level is possible |
| `task verify:<server\|web\|android\|apple\|desktop>` | Print the exact verification commands for a platform |
| `task check` | Cheap cross-platform checks: naming, file size, colors, i18n, boundaries, knip, migrations, tokens |
| `task check:file-size` / `check:colors` / `check:i18n` / `check:boundaries` / `check:naming` | One check at a time |
| `task lint` / `task test` / `task build` | Every platform whose toolchain is installed |
| `pnpm --dir packages/design-tokens build` | Regenerate design tokens for all platforms (never hand-edit generated files) |

## Where the rules live

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Naming, file size | `CONVENTIONS.md` and `docs/agent/conventions/<platform>.md` |
| Approved libraries, version policy, rejections | `docs/content/library-first.md` and `docs/content/library-first/<platform>.md` |
| Decisions and "revisit when" | `docs/content/decisions.md` and `docs/content/decisions/<platform>.md` |
| UI kit parity, tokens | `docs/content/ui-kit.md`, `packages/design-tokens/README.md` |
| i18n (en, ru, tg, uz, ar) | `docs/content/i18n.md` |
| Per-app rules | `apps/server/AGENTS.md`, `apps/web/AGENTS.md`, platform ADRs |

## Verification status (be honest)

Server and Web build and test. Android is verified on the JVM (unit, assembleDebug, lint, ktlint, detekt) but never run on a device. Apple and Desktop were never compiled or built (no Xcode, Qt/vcpkg): do not claim they build. Details and exit criteria: `docs/content/status.md`.

## Working rules

- Several sessions may share one working tree: do not run git commit, checkout, stash, reset or rebase unless the user asks.
- Verify every version against its registry; write `UNVERIFIED` if you cannot.
- Prefer the Write/Edit tools over shell heredocs for file bodies on Windows (apostrophes and backslashes get mangled).
- `LICENSE` is intentionally absent: the owner has not chosen one. Do not add one.
