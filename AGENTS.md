# AEDST — AI agent instructions

Start at **[docs/agent/INDEX.md](docs/agent/INDEX.md)**. It routes you to the few files that apply to your platform and task; do not read the whole docs tree. Full text of these rules: [docs/agent/rules.md](docs/agent/rules.md).

Always applicable:

1. **[CONVENTIONS.md](CONVENTIONS.md)**: naming for the 5 platforms (Web, Server, Android, Apple, Desktop) and the file-size policy. **Must** rules are enforced by linters and `scripts/check-naming.sh`.
2. **[docs/content/library-first.md](docs/content/library-first.md)**: Library-First standard; platform stack pages are linked from it.
3. **[docs/content/decisions.md](docs/content/decisions.md)**: decisions with rationale and "revisit when". If a proposal contradicts one, do not implement or re-propose it.
4. The `AGENTS.md` of the app you touch (`apps/server`, `apps/web`) and platform ADRs (`apps/server/docs/adr/`, `apps/desktop/docs/adr/`).

## The one rule that matters most

**Do not write code that an existing library or platform already does.** Before creating a utility, hook, component, service, repository, parser, formatter, validator or other abstraction, check in this order: standard library, platform API, libraries already in this repo's `package.json` / `go.mod` / `build.gradle.kts` / `Package.swift` / `vcpkg.json`, existing code in this repo. Write custom code only for a documented technical reason (missing functionality, unsupported platform, incompatible API, unacceptable performance, security/compliance, project-specific domain logic), never "it is simpler to write myself" or "it is only 50 lines".

Approved stack per platform: Web (React Hook Form, Zod, date-fns, dnd-kit, shadcn/ui via `apps/web/src/shared/ui/`, TanStack, nuqs, Biome only), Server (net/http ServeMux, ConnectRPC + Protobuf + Buf, pgx + sqlc + Goose, River, Valkey, jwx, OpenTelemetry), Android (Compose, Hilt, connect-kotlin, Keystore + Tink), Apple (SwiftUI + Observation, GRDB, connect-swift, Nuke, Tuist), Desktop (Qt 6 APIs, vcpkg, protoc-generated messages + `ConnectClient`). The per-platform tables and the explicit-rejections list are in the Library-First pages.

## Process rules

- **Versions**: latest stable, verified against the registry. Never invent or guess a version; if you cannot verify it, write `UNVERIFIED`.
- **Approved before first use is machine-enforced** (knip allowlist on Web; `go mod tidy` + golangci-lint `depguard` on Server). Adding to any allowlist requires updating the matching Library-First page in the same change.
- **Single entry point is `task`** (`mise.toml` pins toolchains). `task doctor` shows what this machine can verify; `task verify:<platform>` prints the exact commands; `task check` runs the cheap cross-platform checks.
- **Generated files are never hand-edited.** Design tokens come from `packages/design-tokens` (Style Dictionary); no color literals in hand-written UI code (`task check:colors`).
- **Language: English only** for rule docs, specs, code comments, commit messages and CI; Russian only in `docs/archive/` and locale resources (see CONVENTIONS.md, "Language policy").
- **File size**: keep hand-written files at or under 300 lines; over 500 fails `task check:file-size` (see CONVENTIONS.md).
- **i18n**: strings live with their module; locales en, ru, tg (web calls Tajik `tj`), uz, ar must stay in parity (`task check:i18n`).
- **Honesty about verification**: Android is verified on the JVM (unit tests, assembleDebug, lint, ktlint, detekt) but never run on a device; Apple and Desktop were statically reviewed only (no Xcode or Qt toolchain in the authoring environment) and the first real build is their acceptance test. Do not claim Apple or Desktop build, or that Android works on a device. Status: [docs/content/status.md](docs/content/status.md).
- **Docs are the source of truth**: when you change an architectural decision, update the Library-First page and the decisions page in the same change.

## Forbidden / do not re-propose (summary)

Full list with rationale: [docs/agent/rules.md](docs/agent/rules.md) and the platform decision pages.

- Server: `golang.org/x/image`, Redis (use Valkey), Redlock, NATS/Kafka/RabbitMQ, a hand-built outbox, a second JWT library, an ORM, chi or any third-party router, self-built identity features.
- Web: RxJS, ESLint/Prettier, a new third-party origin without a CSP update.
- Android: `security-crypto`, Retrofit, Koin, `tv-foundation` lists, a JDK other than 21.
- Apple: XcodeGen, SwiftData, swift-perception, a hand-written image loader, SwiftFormat/Periphery (nicklockwood).
- Desktop: Conan, hand-mirrored DTOs, committed generated code, RPCs missing from `contract/methods.hpp`, shipping `QT_QML_DEBUG`.
- Infrastructure as code: Terraform (use OpenTofu only).
- Kept by owner decision (do not propose replacing): Next.js, React Hook Form, the `cn` package, Goose, Qt 6 / C++23, spdlog + Qt logging, GoogleTest + Qt Test, Hilt on AGP 9.
